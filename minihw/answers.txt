	For the first cases sequential was faster than parrallel one. I think it is the problem of relativity. 
	Since I use thread join in for loop it adds additional time for parallel one but when the dimension increases O(n) will increase less than O(n^3).

	No, because the initial matrices do not change and each thread is connected to the individual row of the output matrix.
